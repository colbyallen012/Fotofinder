## General Info

<h4 align="middle">A project where we built an application for uploading an image and saving it to storage for Turing's Front-End Engineering course, Module 1.</h4>


## Motivation

Fotofinder was a project assigned to us as Mod 1 students at Turing. Working with HTML, CSS and JS. This project was for us to demonstrate how to use semantic HTML, clean & organized CSS, DRY JavaScript and how to make localStorage persist data. We also demonstrated how to iterate and filter through dom elements using for loops and array prototype methods, as well as understand the difference between the data model and how data is displayed on the DOM.

Here's the comp we were given:

## Features

- Viewing photos.
- Adding and editing photo title and caption.
- Deleting a photo.
- Filtering and searing by title and caption.
- Show 10 or more most recent photos, ability to toggle and show less.

## How to Use

Fill in the empty text boxes with a title, caption and upload a photo for your new photo care. Upon pressing "Add to album" the application saves your idea on the DOM and in local storage to access later. The user can update the title and body section of existing cards. When the user fills up the page with new photos they can press the 'Show less...' button and reduce the amount of cards on the DOM to 10, and then the 'Show more...' button to show the additional cards. The user can filter through their photo cards by using the search box, and also favorite a photo card by clicking on the heart. The user can also delete a photo card by pressing the delete button.
